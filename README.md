# CSCI4001U â€“ Mobile Devices Final Project

This project features a covid health app, which lists the general hospitals along with all types of clinics (i.e., Vision Centre, Dental clinic, etc.). Users can register through the app, and can get the details of hospital or clinic in the region specified. Our plan is to make the search process more efficient for the user, so if the user wants to look for a certain category, he/she can customize the list accordingly. The main purpose for this application is to make the search for health care institution easier and customizable according to user.
